    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Find Safe</strong> (“Find Safe”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). 
        Find Safe is a marketplace platform that enables users to buy and sell second-hand items and, in the future, goods offered by stores, with a strong focus on safety and fraud prevention.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).
    </p>
    <p>
        By accessing or using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
        If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Scope and Controller</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Find Safe Services worldwide. 
        For the purposes of applicable data protection laws, Find Safe is the controller of your personal information, unless otherwise stated.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>3.2 Government ID and Address Verification Data</h3>
    <p>
        To provide a safer, scam-resistant marketplace and to verify user identities, we may ask certain users (for example, high-risk accounts, frequent sellers, or when required for dispute resolution) to submit:

    <ul>
        <li>Government-issued identity documents (such as national ID, tax ID, driving license, passport, or similar ID),</li>
        <li>Address proof documents (such as utility bills or official documents showing your name and address),</li>
        <li>Selfie photographs or short verification videos to match your identity with submitted documents.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This information is collected solely for identity verification, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, and to comply with applicable legal obligations.
        It is never displayed publicly to other users.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Payment and Financial Information</h3>

        <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> To comply with laws, regulations, court orders, or lawful requests from authorities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>

    <h3>6.1 With Other Users</h3>
    <p>
        When you use the Services, certain profile information and listing information may be visible to other users, such as your username, profile photo, approximate location (e.g., city), ratings, and items you have listed for sale.
        We do <strong>not</strong> publicly display your government ID or full address.
    </p>

    <h3>6.2 With Delivery and Logistics Partners</h3>
    <p>
        To arrange pickup, inspection, and delivery of items, we may share limited information with trusted delivery and logistics partners, such as:

        <li>Name and contact number of sender and recipient,</li>
        <li>Pickup and delivery addresses,</li>
        <li>Order ID and basic product details.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Government ID images or numbers are not shared with delivery partners unless strictly required by law or safety regulations.
    </p>

    <h3>6.3 With Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
        We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing, identity verification, cloud hosting, analytics, marketing (where permitted), and customer support. 
        These providers are bound by contractual obligations to handle your data securely and only for the purposes specified by us.
    </p>

    <h3>6.4 For Legal and Safety Reasons</h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request,</li>
        <li>Enforce our Terms of Use and other policies,</li>
        <li>Protect the rights, property, and safety of Find Safe, our users, delivery partners, or the public,</li>
        <li>Detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.5 Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>
        In connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, sale of assets, or similar transaction, your information may be transferred as part of the business assets. In such a case, we will ensure the receiving party respects this Privacy Policy or provides a similar level of protection.
    </p>

    <h2>7. User-Generated Content and Moderation</h2>
    <p>
        The Services allow users to create and share content, including listings, photos, descriptions, and messages. 
        We may review or monitor such content, using automated tools or manual review, to detect fraud, scams, prohibited items, and violations of our policies.
        Content that violates our policies may be removed, and accounts may be restricted or closed.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We implement technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. 
        Examples include encryption in transit, access controls, and secure storage systems.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:

    <ul>
        <li>For the duration of your account being active,</li>
        <li>For as long as required to complete transactions and resolve disputes,</li>
        <li>For as long as required by legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory obligations,</li>
        <li>For legitimate business needs such as fraud prevention and security.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When your information is no longer needed, we will delete it or anonymize it so that it can no longer be linked to you. 
        If you request deletion of your account, we will deactivate or delete your profile and remove or anonymize personal information, subject to any legal or legitimate retention requirements.
    </p>

        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under this age. 
        If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child, we will take steps to delete such information. 
        If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

    <p>
        The Services may contain links to third-party websites, apps, or services.
